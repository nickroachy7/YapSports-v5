# Next.js Development Focus

- Keep components under 100 lines of code for better maintainability
- Use the Pages Router for simpler projects, App Router for more complex routing needs
- Place all Supabase database calls in dedicated service files
- Implement proper loading states for all data fetching operations
- Create custom hooks for reusable Supabase functionality
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Document all component props with JSDoc or TypeScript interfaces
